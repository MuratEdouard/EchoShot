# 🎮 Echo Shot

_A precision tactical shooter with time-slowing bullets and advanced movement, created for [**GJL Game Parade "Spring" 2025**](https://itch.io/jam/gjl-game-parade-spring-2025)._  
Built with Unity (URP) featuring stylized semi-realistic jungle visuals.

---

## 🧠 Concept

In **Echo Shot**, firing your **first bullet slows down time**, letting you plan your next moves carefully.  
When you fire the **third bullet**, time resumes to normal speed and your gun automatically reloads.  
Master movement with a **double jump** mechanic to evade enemies and reposition tactically.

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

- **Left Click (tap repeatedly)** – Place and fire bullets one by one  
- **Time Slow** – Triggered on firing the first bullet  
- **Time Resume** – Happens after firing the third bullet, reload starts  
- **Double Jump** – Use jump twice to navigate vertically and avoid attacks  

---

## 🖼️ Visual Style

The game uses a **Stylized Semi-Realistic Jungle** environment with lush foliage, atmospheric lighting, and vibrant colors powered by Unity's URP pipeline.
